# FactoryExample
Nike Factory
> Project Status: under development
```
Created an example to describe the use of the factory method design pattern.
```
Ex: Assuming that Nike manufactures only soccer balls. However, the current market also wants a volleyball. So the created structure could build both using factory method.
